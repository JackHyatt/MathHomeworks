\item Use Kempe chains to prove that every planar graph with at most 11 vertices is $4$-colorable.
\begin{proof}
	Assume that $G$ is a 11-vertex planar graph, then there are at most $3(11)-6=27$ edges. By handshaking lemma, we have 54 incidences to distribute between 11 vertices, guaranteeing a vertex with a degree of 4 or fewer. Now to consider a vertex with degree 4 or fewer.
	By the five color theorem, we know that every planar graph with at most 11 vertices is $5$-colorable. Assume we have some 5 coloring. Let us consider every vertex of color 5, called $v$.\\
	\textbf{Case 1}: $v$ has neighbors of only 3 or less other colors.\\
	Then we can color $v$ a different color that is not color 5.\\
	\textbf{Case 2}: $v$ has neighbors of all other 4 colors.\\
	For colors $i,j$, let $G_{i,j}$ be the subgraph induced by colors $i$ and $j$.\\
	\textbf{Case 2.1}: $v$ has 2 neighbors in different components in $G_{i,j}$ for some distinct $i,j\in [4]$\\
	WLOG, let those neighbors be color 1 and color 3. Then we can swap the vertices of color 1 and color 3 in the connected component containing the color 1 neighbor. Now we are at case 1.\\
	\textbf{Case 2.2}: $v$'s neighbors are all in the same component of every $G_{i,j}$.\\
	So there must be Kempe chains between any two neighbors of $v$. This means the paths between 1 to 3 and 2 to 4 would cross, making it not planar.

\item Determine if the following graphs are planar or nonplanar. If it is planar, give a plane drawing. If it is nonplanar, demonstrate the existence of a $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ subdivision.

Here is the first one drawn planar:\\
\begin{center}
	\tikz \graph [nodes={draw, circle}, clockwise] {
		subgraph C_n [V={1,6,4}, radius=4cm] -- subgraph C_n [V={5,2,3}, phase=150, radius=.3cm, nodes={yshift=.25cm}];
		4--5; 1--2; 6--3;
	};
\end{center}


Here is the second one drawn with the $K_5$ subdivision, with subdivided edges highlighted red:\\
\begin{center}
	\tikz \graph [nodes={draw, circle}] {
		subgraph C_n [V={1,2,3,4}, radius=5cm, phase=135, clockwise];
		{[path, --, edges={"red"}, branch right sep=1cm, nodes={xshift=-2cm}] 5,7,6};
		{[induced path, edges={"red"}] 2,3,4};

\item Let $X$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^2$ such that the (Euclidean) distance between any pair of distinct points in $X$ is at least 1. Prove that there are at most $3n-6$ pairs of points with distance exactly 1. 

\begin{proof}
	Let $X$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^2$ such that the (Euclidean) distance between any pair of distinct points in $X$ is at least 1, and let $G$ be the graph of those points with the edges between points when there are distance 1 apart. BWOC, assume there are more than $3n-6$ edges. This means $G$ is nonplanar, which means there is a $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ minor.\\
	There cannot be a $K_5$ minor since if we had a $K_3$ (3 points each dist 1 away), we can center a unit circle at each vertex and the three circles only intersect at 3 points. That means no other vertex could have an edge between all 3.\\
	There cannot be a $K_{3,3}$ for similar reasoning. If we have a vertex adjacent to 3 other vertices, then we can draw a unit circle centered at that vertex. Those 3 vertices are on the circle, and we know that a circle is uniquely defined by 3 points on it, so no other vertex can be adjacent to all three of those vertices.
\end{proof}

\item Recall that a graph is outerplanar if it has a plane drawing with all of its vertices touching the outer face.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $n \geq 2$. Prove that every $n$-vertex outerplanar graph has at most $2n-3$ edges. 
\begin{proof}
	Let us induct on n\\
	Base case: n=2\\
	This has at most 1 edge ($2n-3$) and is outerplanar.\checkmark \\
	Induction step:\\
	Let $n>2$. Assume the proposition for any outplanar graph with $n'<n$ vertices.\\
	Let $G$ be a $n$-vertex outerplanar graph. Let us remove a vertex, $v$, with degree $\leq$2 (we know one exists from class). By induction hypothesis, $G-v$ has at most $2n-5$ edges. If we add back $v$, we'd be at most adding back 2 edges, so we'd have at most $2n-5+2 = 2n-3$ edges.
\end{proof}
\item Show that part (a) is best possible for all $n\geq 2$ by iteratively constructing graphs $G_2, G_3, G_4, \ldots$ such that $G_n$ is an $n$-vertex, outerplanar graph with $2n-3$ edges.\m
An iterative definition is to take the drawing, and then add a vertex outside of the drawing, connecting it to two vertices that are adjacent by an edge on the outerface.

\item Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph. Suppose for some $t \in \mathbb N$ that $d(u) + d(v) \geq n-t$ for every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices $u,v \in V(G)$. Prove that the vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into at most $t$ pairwise-disjoint paths.
\begin{proof}
	Let $G$ be an $n$ vertex graph and suppose $\exists t \in \N$ that $d(u) + d(v) \geq n-t$ for every pair of distinct non-adjacent vertices $u,v \in V(G)$. Let us add $t$ vertices that are adjacent to every vertex. Then every vertex's degree goes up by $t$, which will satisfy Ore's condition.  By Ore's theorem, we have that this graph is Hamiltonian. Removing the $t$ vertices add will now make turn the cycle into at most $t$ paths.
\end{proof}
