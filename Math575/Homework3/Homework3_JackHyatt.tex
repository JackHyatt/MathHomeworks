\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove that a forest with $n$ vertices and $c$ components contains exactly $n-c$ edges.

\begin{proof}
	We shall induct on the number of components.\\
	\textbf{Base case}: $c=1$\\
	Since $c=1$, that means we have just one tree. A tree has $|E| = n-1 = n-c$.\\\\
	\textbf{Induction Step}: Suppose we have a forest, $F$, with $n$ vertices and $c>1$ components, and let every forest with $n'$ vertices and $c'<c$ components have exactly $n'-c'$ edges.\\
	Then $F$ has $c$ trees. Let us remove 1 tree, we'll call this removed tree T. Assume T has $n_1$ vertices, which means it has $n_1-1$ edges. So $F\backslash T$ has $n-n_1$ vertices and $c-1$ components. By the induction hypothesis, we know $F\backslash T$ has $n-n_1-(c-1) = n-n_1-c+1$ edges. Let us now add back $T$. So we added back $n_1$ vertices and $n_1-1$ edges.
	\[E(F) = E(F\backslash T) + E(T) = (n-n_1-c+1) + (n-1) = n-c\]
	QED by P.M.I.
\end{proof}

\item Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex tree with $\Delta(G) \leq 2$. Prove that $G$ must be isomorphic to the path $P_n$. 
\begin{proof}
	We shall induct on the number of vertices.\\
	\textbf{Base case}: $n=1$\\
	Trivially obvious.\\
	\textbf{Induction Step}: Suppose we have a tree, $G$, with $n>1$ vertices and $\Delta(G) \leq 2$, and let every graph, $G'$ with $n'<n$ vertices and $\Delta(G') \leq 2$ be isomorphic to $P_{n'}$.\\
	We know that every tree has at least 1 leaf vertex. Let $\ell$ be a leaf vertex of $G$, and we shall remove it from $G$. $G$ will still be a tree and has less than $n$ vertices. Since we only removed a vertex, $\Delta(G-\ell)$ could not have gone up. So we can apply our induction hypothesis to $G-\ell$, showing $G-\ell$ is isomorphic to $P_{n-1}$.\\
	Since $G-\ell$ is isomorphic to $P_{n-1}$, adding $\ell$ to $G-\ell$ is equivalent to adding $\ell$ to $P_{n-1}$. We know that adding $\ell$ would not create a vertex of degree 3 or more due to $\Delta(G) \leq 2$, so $\ell$ would be added to a vertex in $P_{n-1}$ with degree less than 2. This means $\ell$ is added to an end point vertex in $P_{n-1}$, which lengthens the path to $P_n$.\\
	QED by P.M.I.
\end{proof}

\item Suppose $G$ is a graph with the property that deleting any single vertex (and its incident edges) results in a tree.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What can we say about the number of edges in $G$ and the degrees of its vertices?\\\\
Let $n$ be the number of vertices in $G$. Since deleting any single vertex results in a tree, and those trees will \emph{always} have $(n-1)-1$ edges, we know that every vertex has the same degree. So $G$ is $k$-regular. So $G$ has $nk/2$ edges. Since removing a single vertex results in $n-2$ edges and that vertex has degree $k$, G also has $n-2+k$ edges. 

\item Use part (a) to determine $G$ itself.\\\\
\[\frac{nk}{2}=n-2+k \implies k(n-2)=2(n-2) \implies k=2\]
So $G$ is 2-regular, and connected since the sub-trees are connected. This and the above algebra means that $G$ is a cycle graph when $n\neq2$. However, the case where $n=1$ or $n=2$ still works, even if it is 2 disconnected vertices. Since they're crappy edge cases that work, lets just throw them in with the ``$G$ must be a $C_n$" conclusion. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $G$ be a connected, weighted graph with $n$ vertices. Let $xy$ be an edge of largest weight in $G$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove or disprove: there must exist a MST of $G$ that avoids the edge $xy$.\\\\
Disproving by counter example: Let $G$ be just the vertices $x$ and $y$. Then the \emph{only} MST of $G$ must contain $xy$.\\ 

\item Prove that if $xy$ is contained in a cycle in $G$, then there exists a MST of $G$ that avoids the edge $xy$.
\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ be a spanning tree containing $xy$. If we delete $xy$, we will get 2 subtrees, with one containing $x$ and the other containing $y$. Let's denote these subtrees as $T_x$ and $T_y$ respectively. In $T_x$, there must be one vertex with an edge in $G$ that connects to $T_y$ that is not $xy$, since $xy$ was part of a cycle. Let us add that edge to connect $T_x$ and $T_y$. This edge must have weight less than or equal to $xy$ since $xy$ had the highest weight. So the weight could not have increased. This means that if we found a MST s.t. $xy$ was contained, we can swap it out with the above technique.
\end{proof}

\end{enumerate}

\item Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find a shortest path tree starting with the vertex $a$. At each step of the algorithm, write the edge that was added to the tree.
