\item For positive integers $n$ and $k$, consider the graph $G(n,k)$ which is defined as follows: the vertex set of $G(n,k)$ is the set of subsets of $[n]$ of size $k$, and two vertices are connected by an edge in $G(n,k)$ if and only if the corresponding subsets are disjoint. \footnote{ E.g., $V(G(4,2)) = \{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4\}\}$ and \[E(G(4,2)) = \{\{\{1,2\},\{3,4\}\}, \qquad \{\{1,3\},\{2,4\}\},\qquad \{\{1,4\},\{2,3\}\}\} \]}

\item A graph is called {\bf $k$-regular} if every vertex has degree $k$.

\item Prove that if $k$ is odd, then there does not exist a $k$-regular graph with an odd number of vertices. 
\begin{proof}
	Assume we have a graph, G, that is k-regular, where k is odd. Assume towards contradiction that G has an odd number of vertices, namely n. By Handshaking lemma, summing up the degrees of the vertices will be an even number, but in G, it will be $nk$. This is an odd number multiplied by an odd number, which is not even. \begin{tikzpicture}
			\node[starburst, draw, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=2cm,line width=1.5pt,red,fill=yellow,scale=.5]
		{BOOM, A CONTRADICTION!!!};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\item Prove that every graph $G$ must contain a pair of vertices with the same degree. 

\begin{proof}
	Let $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ be the vertices of G, and $d_i$ be the degree of $v_i$. There are $n$ different possible numbers $d_i$ can be, namely $0,...,n-1$. If a vertex has a degree of $n-1$, then it is neighbors to every other vertex, making another vertex having a degree of 0 impossible. So a graph with every degree is impossible, meaning a graph can at most have $n-1$ different $d_i$'s. So by PHP, matching $n$ vertices to $n-1$ degrees must result in 2 vertices having the same degree.
\end{proof}

\item Let $G$ be a graph with $V(G) = \{v_1, \ldots, v_n\}$. Recall that the {\em adjacency matrix} of $G$ is the $n \times n$ matrix $A$ such that $A_{ij} = 1$ if $v_iv_j \in E(G)$ and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. Use induction to prove that for all integers $k \geq 1$, the $(i,j)$-entry of $A^k$ is equal to the number of $v_i,v_j$-walks of length $k$ in $G$. 
\begin{proof}
	Let us induct on the degree of adjacency matrix A.\\
	Base case: \boldsymbol{$k=1$}\\
	Obvious by the definition of adjacency matrix.\medskip\\
	Induction step: Assume that A is an adjacency matrix of G and that the $(i,j)$-entry of $A^k$ is equal to the number of $v_i,v_j$-walks of length k in G. Let us right multiply A to get $A^k\cdot A=A^{k+1}$. Looking at the $(i,j)$-entry of $A^{k+1}$, we get it from the dot product of the ith row of $A^k$ and the jth column of A. Each element in the ith row of $A^k$ is the number of walks from vertex $i$ to each intermediate vertex $q$, and those entries will be multiplied by 0 if that intermediate vertex $q$ is not adjacent to $j$. This means those walks of length $k$ starting at vertex $i$ that cannot reach $j$ by adding one more edge to the end are not added. The walks of length $k$ that do reach $j$ after adding an edge to the end of the walk are added, since the number they are being multiplied by is 1 in the jth column of $A$. So we are left with the number of walks from vertex $i$ to an intermediate vertex $q$ (walk of length $k$) to vertex $j$, which gives a walk of length $k+1$. 
	
\end{proof}

\item Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with degree sequence $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the degree sequence of $\overline{G}$?
\\$(n-1-d_1,n-1-d_2,\ldots,n-1-d_n)$ is the sequence.
\item A graph $G$ is called {\em self-complementary} if it is isormophic to its complement. Prove that if $G$ is self-complementary, then either $n$ or $n-1$ is divisible by 4.
\begin{proof}
	Assume G is self-complementary. This means that $|E(G)|$ is half of the total number of edges for the complete graph with the same number of vertices, since $G\cup\overline{G}=K_n$. So $|E(K_n)|=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \implies |E(G)|=\frac{n(n-1)}{4}$. And since $|E(G)|$ is a whole number, 4 must divide $n$ or $n-1$.
\end{proof}
\item Show that for all $n$ divisible by 4, there exists a self-complementary graph on $n$ vertices. \footnote{Hint: generalize the structure of the path $P_4$.}
\begin{proof}
	The rule set for enumerated vertices: $v_iv_j$ is an edge in the graph
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item if $v_i\equiv 1 \mod 4 \la (v_j\equiv 1 \mod 4 \lor v_j\equiv 2\mod4)$
		\item if $v_i\equiv 2 \mod 4 \la (v_j\equiv 1 \mod 4 \lor v_j\equiv 3\mod4)$
		\item if $v_i\equiv 3 \mod 4 \la (v_j\equiv 2 \mod 4 \lor v_j\equiv 0\mod4)$
		\item if $v_i\equiv 0 \mod 4 \la (v_j\equiv 3 \mod 4 \lor v_j\equiv 0\mod4)$
	\end{enumerate}
	gives a self complementary graph on $4k$ vertices.\\
	We will show the above statement by inducting on $n=4k$.\\
	Base case: \boldsymbol{$k=1$}\\
	The $P_4$ graph is self-complementary.

	Induction Step: Assume we have a simple graph, G, such that there are $4k$ vertices $\{v_1,\ldots,v_{4k}\}$, with the rules stated in the beginning, where $k\geq2$.
	(This is the pattern shown in base case $k=2$)\\
	Let us add 4 vertices to the graph and apply the rule to those vertices. We know from the base case $k=2$ that the subgraph of this new "layer" and any other layer will be self-complementary. Since the vertices in the new layer are self complementary with every other layer, and the other layers were already self-complementary in total, this new graph with $4(k+1)$ vertices is also self complementary.
\end{proof}
\item Show that for all $n$ such that $n-1$ is divisible by $4$, there exists a self-complementary graph on $n$ vertices. \footnote{Hint: add a vertex to a construction in part (c).}\\\\
In part (c), we constructed a graph with 4k vertices that was self-complementary. Let us add a single vertex to our graph. It is now not self-complementary. To make it self complementary, we must connect the vertex to the "outer" vertices in each "row". This makes the graph self-complementary, since the vertices our new vertex is adjacent to in the complement graph are now the "outer" vertices (i.e. 2 and 3 become the outer vertices), and we still have half the total possible edges. So now we have a self-complementary construction for every graph with n vertices where $4|(n-1)$.
